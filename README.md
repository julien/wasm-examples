wasm-examples
-------------

Various [wasm](http://webassembly.org/) examples.

Follow [these instructions](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) to get everything setup.

Some examples might break, I'm mostly using this repository
to get started with **wasm** and learn.

All contributions are welcome!
